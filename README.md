## Overview
Granite is a web development framework for Node.js. The focus of
the framework is providing the foundation for building enterprise
level applications and services. This is achieved by providing the
well designed OOP architecture with solid structural and behavioral
guidelines and enforcements. Granite takes it seriously, therefore
provides an out of the box support for the broad spectrum of service
lifecycle management techniques that allows to bundle each service
with things like documentation, testing and a slew of other aspects.
This unique architecture outlines services as the primary entities
that encompass not only the service implementation but also all the
things that come with it, such as documentation, tests and so on.
These things are well integrated with the framework which allows for
a very rapid creation of extremely well designed and well decoupled
services with a rock solid architecture. Granite also bundles some
unique approaches and systems, such as the class composition system
along with a unique, code driven approach for crafting UI/UX.

##Concept
The Granite framework is built around the concept of being entirely
code driven. That means it diverts from the modern ideas of heavily
using markup languages and declarative techniques, such as HTML, CSS,
QML and other of a kind. Instead, it provides a powerful foundation
for expressing everything in terms of coding, objects and events in
an asynchronous fashion, mostly, in order to match the Node.js idioms.
The Granite was engineered for perfectly matching the one-man-show
scenario, when one or more programmers have to do the job of an entire
team. The framework provides a unique way of the client/server site
integration that allows for entirely transparent data and event passing.
The overall architecture of Granite makes it perfect for engineers.
